## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- Link to creating sounds with audiocontext: https://www.the-art-of-web.com/javascript/creating-sounds/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
There was not a specific challenge that I encountered while creating this submission since I have worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the past.
However, I was not familiar with creating audio on a webpage before since this is not something that is very common in web development so I decided to 
learn more about it. I went to the link provided on the pre-work to read the documentation and learn more about the various methods and the functionality.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
A question about web development I have after completing this submission is that in this pre-work assignment, we created a simple game on the browser. Most of the games I am familiar with
usually are played on desktop apps such as games like League of Legends or Minecraft. I have also not come across many games being played on the browser so I was wondering if there was a limit to how complex a 
game on the browser could be. When I think of web development, I usually think about e-commerce websites or social media platforms and not really games so it would be interesting to know if creating games on 
web browsers is something that is fairly common and if not, why?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Since I came across this application fairly close to the deadline, I did not have much time experimenting with the additional features. One of the additional feature that I would have spent some
time doing is making it so that the game button sound is more complex than a single tone. I took some time to read the documentation on using AudioContext in Javascript so it would been nice to learn more about this by
implementing this additional feature. I would probably have needed more guidance on this so I would probably search for some Youtube tutorials to see if anyone has done something similar so I would be able to learn how to best
achieve this goal by applying the things I learned from the video to this game.
